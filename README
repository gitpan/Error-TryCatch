Error-TryCatch
==============

Error::TryCatch implements exception handling (try-catch) blocks 
functionality with an interface similiar to Error.pm (in fact, it's almost 
a drop-in replacement). The main difference is that it's a source filter 
module.

As a source filter it can implement the same convenient interface without 
those nasty memory leaks and implicit anonymous subroutines (which can trick 
you, if you're not careful). Also after source parsing it converts the code
into "native" perl code, so it's probably a little faster than Error.pm's
approach.

And, well. As far as I can tell, Error::TryCatch accomplishes its duty nicely.
